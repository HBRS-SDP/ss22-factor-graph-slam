    - a markdown file with functions and algorithms needed for implementing factor graphs in C

- **examples** contains <br>
    - basic tutorials in C for the GNU - GSL library (derived from the GSL documentation)
    - makefile to run the c codes in examples directory all at once (If you want to run the c files individually, follow the compiling procedure provided in the installation folder)
